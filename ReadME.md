# GoLang Backend, React Frontend, and WebSockets Project

This is a basic project designed to provide hands-on experience with building a web application using GoLang for the backend, React for the frontend, and WebSockets for real-time communication. The aim is to learn the integration and workings of these technologies in a simple yet effective way.

## Features
- **Backend:** A simple GoLang server with WebSocket support.
- **Frontend:** A React application for displaying real-time data and interacting with the backend.
- **WebSockets:** Real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm or yarn

## Project Setup

### Backend Setup (GoLang)
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install necessary Go modules:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Run the Go server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

### Connecting Frontend and Backend
Ensure the WebSocket URL in the React application matches the WebSocket server address in your Go backend (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080`).

## Directory Structure
```

## Learning Goals
- Understand how to set up a GoLang server and handle WebSocket connections.
- Build a React frontend to interact with the backend.
- Implement real-time features using WebSockets.

## Notes
This project is meant for learning purposes. Feel free to modify, break, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
